# Design 01 — Data layer: domain models + wire envelopes + mapping

**Component scope (Phase 1, text-only):** the immutable data types the rest of the app
is written against — domain models (`lib/shared/models/` or `features/chat/domain/`),
wire DTOs (`features/chat/data/transport/envelopes.dart`), and the conversion functions
between them. No transport, no cache, no UI here — just the shapes and their boundary.

Reviewed-as-one because the wire↔domain *mapping* is the bug surface; the types alone are trivial.

## Source of truth (gateway, verified by reading the running code)

The gateway's `/v1` contract is **frozen** (plan §A1). Phase 1 frames, byte-exact from
`aiko_chat_gateway/src/aiko_gateway/realtime/envelopes.py` + `domain/messages_service.py`
+ `rest/auth.py`:

**Client → server (WSS):**
- `{"type":"subscribe", "channel_ids": [str, ...]}`
- `{"type":"send", "client_msg_id": str, "channel_id": str, "body": str, "reply_to": str|null}`
  — **no sender field by construction** (invariant I5: server derives sender from JWT).

**Server → client (WSS):**
- `{"type":"ack", "client_msg_id": str, "msg_id": str, "created_at": iso8601}`
- `{"type":"message", "msg": MessageView}`
- `{"type":"error", "code": str, "detail": str, "ref_client_msg_id": str|null}`

**MessageView** (the `msg` payload, and the shape REST history returns):
```
{ "msg_id": str(ULID), "channel_id": str,
  "sender": {"user_id": str|null, "kind": "human"|"actor"|"llm"|"robot", "label": str|null},
  "body": str, "created_at": iso8601, "reply_to": str|null }
```

**REST** (all shapes re-verified against `main.py` + `rest/auth.py`, 2026-06-21):
- `POST /v1/auth/register|login` → `{access_token, refresh_token, user: UserView}`
- `POST /v1/auth/refresh` → `{access_token}`  *(refresh NOT rotated — same refresh token stays valid)*
- `GET /v1/me` → `UserView`  *(auth'd — `CurrentUser` dep)*
- `UserView` = `{user_id, username, display_name, aiko_username}`
- `GET /v1/channels` → `{"channels": [{id, name, kind, aiko_channel}]}`  (main.py:120; inline `@app.get`, **NOT** a router)
- `GET /v1/channels/{channel_id}/messages?before=<cursor>&limit=<=200` → `{"channel_id", "messages": [MessageView], "next_before": str|null}`  (main.py:130). Cursor is **`next_before`** (oldest id in batch); pass it as the next `before`. `limit` default 50, max 200.

> ⚠️ **Gateway gap (NOT a Phase-1 app blocker, captured as a task):** `GET /v1/channels` and the history endpoint have **no auth dependency** — they're currently *unauthenticated* (I1 not enforced on REST reads; only the WS handshake + `/v1/me` are guarded). The app SHOULD still send the bearer token (forward-proof for when the guard lands), but must not assume a 401 today. Channels-list shape omits `is_private` (gateway model has it; wire doesn't send it) — so the app can't show a privacy indicator until the wire carries it.

## Domain models (Phase 1 subset of plan §B3)

Codegen note: the **full** model layer (all phases) exceeds 10 types, and the plan (§B3,
§B5) commits to Freezed + the `veilid_chat` Freezed seed. So this project uses Freezed —
overriding the global "hand-write unless large" default *because the full layer is large*.
Flagged for veto. Phase 1 generates only the types below.

### `Message` — the two-id design (the crux of the whole app)
| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `clientTempId` | `String` | **durable cache PK, survives forever.** Generated client-side (uuid v4) at compose time. Never null. |
| `id` | `String?` | server ULID. **null until `ack` arrives.** This nullability is load/write-symmetry's whole point (see Invariants). |
| `channelId` | `String` | |
| `sender` | `MessageSender` | `{userId: String?, kind: SenderKind, label: String?}` — mirrors wire `sender`. **`label` is nullable** (gateway `_msg_view` main.py:105 passes `m.sender_label` through, which is `nullable=True`; an inbound `"label": null` MUST NOT throw — review finding #4). userId null for external actors. UI falls back to `username`/`kind` when label null. |
| `kind` | `MessageKind` | Phase 1: only `text`. enum reserves `image/video/voice/system` for later. |
| `body` | `String` | |
| `replyToId` | `String?` | server ULID of replied-to msg (Phase 1 carries it but UI ignores) |
| `createdAt` | `DateTime` | from server on ack/message; for optimistic rows, **client clock at enqueue** (provisional, replaced on ack). |
| `deliveryState` | `DeliveryState` | `sending \| sent \| delivered \| read \| failed`. Phase 1 uses `sending \| sent \| failed` (delivered/read are Phase 4). |

`SenderKind` enum: `human, actor, llm, robot` — **unknown wire value → `actor`** (forward-compat: a future kind must not crash an old client; it degrades to the generic external-actor rendering). Decision: lenient decode, never throw on an unknown enum string.

### Other Phase-1 types
- `Channel` `{id, name, kind}` (`ChannelKind: standard|llm|robot|dm`, unknown → `standard`).
- `AppUser` `{userId, username, displayName, aikoUsername}` (named `AppUser` to avoid clashing Flutter's `User`).
- `AuthTokens` `{accessToken, refreshToken}`.
- `OutgoingMessage` `{clientTempId, channelId, body, replyToId?}` — the outbox/enqueue record; what `ChatTransport.sendMessage` consumes.

## Wire DTOs (`envelopes.dart`)
Thin parse/build layer; **all wire knowledge isolated here** so a contract change touches one file.
- Inbound: `ServerFrame.fromJson` → sealed `AckFrame | MessageFrame | ErrorFrame | UnknownFrame`.
  Unknown `type` → `UnknownFrame(raw)` (logged, dropped) — never throws (an additive server frame must not kill the socket).
- Outbound: `SubscribeFrame`, `SendFrame` → `toJson`.
- `MessageView.fromJson` → builds a `Message` with `id = msg_id`, `clientTempId = ???` (see edge case E2).

## Mapping (the interesting part)

| wire | domain | rule |
|---|---|---|
| `MessageView.msg_id` | `Message.id` | non-null on inbound |
| `ack.client_msg_id`,`ack.msg_id`,`ack.created_at` | reconcile existing optimistic row | find row by `clientTempId == ack.client_msg_id`; set `id`, `createdAt`, `deliveryState=sent` |
| `MessageView.sender` | `Message.sender` | kind via lenient enum decode |
| `send` (out) | from `OutgoingMessage` | `client_msg_id = clientTempId` — **same value**, the join key |

## Invariants (state these before the mechanism — global pref)

1. **Load/write symmetry.** A `Message` with `id == null` (un-acked, app killed mid-send) MUST round-trip through cache load AND save without throwing. ONE predicate per field at the boundary. No "lenient load + strict save" gap. (This is why `id` is `String?` end-to-end, not a sentinel `""`.)
2. **`clientTempId` is the eternal PK; `id` is a late-arriving secondary key.** Reconciliation upserts on `clientTempId` FIRST, then `id` — so the server's own echo of our message dedupes against the optimistic row instead of duplicating it.
3. **No throw on unknown enum / unknown frame.** Forward-compat: server may add `sender.kind` values or frame types; old client degrades, never crashes.
4. **`send` frame has no sender field.** If a future refactor is tempted to add one "for convenience," that's an I5 violation — the server ignores/​rejects it anyway.

## Edge cases the reviewer should attack
- **E1 (RESOLVED):** `ack` for a `clientTempId` we have no row for (app restarted, outbox row lost but server still acked). **Drop + log is the only option** — the ack carries no `body`/`channel_id`/`sender` (envelopes.py:14-16), so a row can't be materialized from it. Recovery is real: the **history endpoint exists** (main.py:130), so on reconnect `GET .../messages` re-fetches the message. Also: on an idempotent *resend* (same `client_msg_id`), the gateway returns the existing row, **sends the ack but skips fanout** (ws.py:84, `created=False`) — so reconcile on the ack alone; do NOT expect a second echo on retry.
- **E2 (RESOLVED — guaranteed by gateway ordering):** inbound `message` frame for a message WE sent (the server echo) — `MessageView` has `msg_id` but **no `client_msg_id`**. Dedup: the `ack` reconciles our optimistic row (sets `id`); the echoed `message` frame is deduped by `id` (row with that `id` exists → drop). **Ordering is deterministic, NOT racy:** `ws.py:_handle_send` sends the `ack` (line 82) *before* `hub.fanout` (line 89), both on the single asyncio loop — so the ack always reaches the sender before its echo. **The cache need NOT buffer the sender's own echo.** Caveat: the sender only receives the echo if subscribed to the channel (fanout targets = subscribed conns); if it sent without subscribing it gets the ack only (still reconciles). (Review-confirmed against ws.py:82/89, hub.py:44.)
- **E3:** `created_at` provisional clock skew — optimistic row sorts wrong until ack replaces it. Acceptable (sub-second flicker)?
- **E4:** body with only whitespace — gateway rejects (`body.strip()`); client should pre-validate to avoid a round-trip error.
- **E5:** very long body / unicode / emoji — any truncation or encoding assumption?

## Test plan (ATDD — written before impl)
- `fromJson`/`toJson` round-trip for every frame + MessageView.
- Unknown enum string → `actor`/`standard`, no throw.
- Unknown frame type → `UnknownFrame`, no throw.
- `Message(id: null)` → cache encode/decode round-trip equal (symmetry).
- ack reconcile: optimistic row + ack(sameTempId) → one row, id set, state=sent.

## Resolved by adversarial review (2026-06-21)
1. ✅ **E2 ack-before-echo: GUARANTEED** by gateway ordering (ws.py:82 before :89, single loop). No buffering of the sender's own echo. See E2 above.
2. ✅ **`seq`: DEFER, confirmed.** Gateway emits no `seq` on any frame (envelopes.py:14-25; ids.py:6 comment "no separate sequence needed"). Plan §A1 is aspirational; the doc tracks the code. No `seq`/`aikoOrigin` field in the Phase-1 `Message`.
3. **Freezed vs hand-written** — decision REVISED after pinning versions: `flutter pub add` resolved Freezed to `3.2.6-dev.1` (a dev prerelease). Given (a) Phase-1 layer is only ~6 types, (b) global pref = hand-write unless large, (c) dev-version codegen risk, (d) the lenient-decode/two-id/symmetry invariants are clearer hand-written — **hand-write Phase-1 models**; adopt Freezed when the layer grows (later phase). build_runner retained for drift + riverpod codegen.
4. ✅ **`label` nullable** (finding #4) — fixed to `String?` above; real crash bug averted.
5. ✅ **REST history/channels exist** (finding #3 refuted by direct read of main.py:120/130) — shapes corrected above. Both currently unauthed (captured as a gateway task).
